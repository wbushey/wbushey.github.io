Celebrity Bar Fight is a website (located at
<http://www.celebritybarfight.com>) that lets you decide who would win in a
drunken bar fight between two celebrities. The site is something that my friend
David and I work on in our spare time; we use it to learn, to amuse, and to
have fun.

The site was inspired by a game David and I would play at the bar. We would
name two celebrities, then argue about who would win in a no-rules bar fight
(assuming both celebrities were in their peak condition.) This would usually
entertain us for awhile, and we often ended up getting others at the bar to
play along. And for those who are wondering, yes, this game was itself inspired
by the conversation in Fight Club in which Edward Norton and Brad Pitt talk
about which celebrity they most wanted to fight.
