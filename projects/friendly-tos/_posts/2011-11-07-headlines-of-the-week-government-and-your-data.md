### Headlines of the Week

> A number of activists have voiced their concern over the terms of Google Plus
> that require users to supply their real names. In particular, the policy has
> been criticized as inconsistent and favoring the famous (since celebrities
> have been able to use their stage names), disrespecting of those who choose
> an identity of their own, and inconsiderate of those who need to hide their
> identity for their own safety. In the face of these criticisms, Google has
> announced that in the future, [Google Plus users will be able to use pseudonyms][1]
> on their profiles.

### Government and Your Data

> The law allows government agencies to access data about you. Your consent to
> website terms allows government agencies to access data about you. This is
> not a comment on the state of citizen rights, nor is it an Orwellian critique
> of government surveillance. This is simply a reminder that if you put
> information online, or make use of Internet services, the possibility exists
> that the government can access that information for some compelling reason.
