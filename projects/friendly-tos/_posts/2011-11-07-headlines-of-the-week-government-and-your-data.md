### Government and Your Data

> The law allows government agencies to access data about you. Your consent to
> website terms allows government agencies to access data about you. This is
> not a comment on the state of citizen rights, nor is it an Orwellian critique
> of government surveillance. This is simply a reminder that if you put
> information online, or make use of Internet services, the possibility exists
> that the government can access that information for some compelling reason.

## ECPA's 25th Anniversary

This week marked the 25th anniversary of the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act, a law that establishes privacy protections for electronic communications
from government actions, such as interceptions and searches. Because it was
written in 1986, the act doesn't explicitly talk about a lot of Internet
technologies, including email, IM, and social network messages. And for this
reason, [groups][4] and [senators][5] have used this anniversary to call for
the ECPA to be updated to cover the forms of communication that most Americans
use today.

## Google Plus To Allow pseudonyms

A number of activists have voiced their concern over the terms of Google Plus
that require users to supply their real names. In particular, the policy has
been criticized as inconsistent and favoring the famous (since celebrities have
been able to use their stage names), disrespecting of those who choose an
identity of their own, and inconsiderate of those who need to hide their
identity for their own safety. In the face of these criticisms, Google has
announced that in the future,
[Google Plus users will be able to use pseudonyms][6] on their profiles.

## Google Defaulting to SSL Searches

In more Google news, the search giant has decided to
[enable SSL by default for searches][7] conducted by a user who is logged in.
This is great news for the privacy and security of users, since SSL protects
users from having their searches intercepted by others, or having results
redirect to nefarious sites.

## Canadian Supreme Court Says Links Are Not Defamation

In Canadian free speech news,
[Canada's Supreme Court has ruled that a page or post that links to a defamatory][8]
site is not itself defamation (false statements that seriously damage one's
reputation) - meaning that Canadian's do not have to worry about being sued for
merely linking to a defaming page.
