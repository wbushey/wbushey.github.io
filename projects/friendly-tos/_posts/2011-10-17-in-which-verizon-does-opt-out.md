*If you are a Verizon Wireless customer who wants to opt-out of Verizon's new
mobile ad targeting program, [click here][1].*

Is it right for a company to automatically enroll its customers into new
information sharing services? Whether it is right or not, the act of
automatically enrolling customers and users into sharing information is
disturbingly common. [Facebook][2] has [famously][3] done [this][4] multiple
[times][5]. A few weeks ago, a judge allowed the use of automatic enrollment on
[email addresses involved in Barnes & Noble's purchase of Borders][6]. And last
week, Verizon sent an email to its smart phone customers, letting them know
they are being [automatically enrolled into the company's new targeted ad program][7].

Automatic enrollment is so common that people often refer to it by a shorter
name: opt-out. Many consumer advocates favor **opt-in**, in which a company has
to get a user's OK before it can enroll her in a new service. However, using
opt-in makes it harder for a company to launch new services or start new
advertising programs. So companies often use **opt-out**: they enroll users
into new services and place the burden on users to remove themselves. Since the
terms of service of most websites include a clause about how users
automatically consent to changes in a site's terms and policies, opt-out is
perfectly legal and an option available to most companies.

Opt-out is certainly questionable, but what makes this bad practice worse is
the terribly unclear process most websites provide users who wish to out-out.
Businesses know they need to provide users with a way to unenroll from new
services unless they want to face consumer backlash, bad PR, or an
investigation from the FTC. But, letting users opt-out is often against a
business's interests. So, businesses will technically provide an opt-out
process, but will put in no effort to make the process easy. The opt-out for
Verizon's new targeted ad program is a great example of this - it takes ten
minutes of clicking links, reading summaries, and reading legalese before the
opt-out link is found buried deep in the company's terms of service.

Consumer advocates are constantly pushing policy makers and industry leaders to
either force the use of opt-in, or make the processes of opt-out easy and
clear. However, policy can be slow to develop, and industry has little
incentive to use opt-in or easy opt-out if they don't have to. So for the time
being, consumers have to remain on the lookout for changes to the sites and
services they use, and be ready to search through terms and policies when they
don't want to be involved in new services.

*Update on 11/04/2011*: [Carnegie-Mellon recently released a report][8]
concerning the difficultly users experience in today's opt-out system. The
report describes how study participants were often unable to find the opt-out
option of major online advertising networks. Those who could successfully find
the opt-out mechanisms spent upwards of 45 minutes searching for the correct
link.
