*Understanding why Internet regulations are the way that they are is confusing.
So, FriendlyToS is creating [The Friendly Guide to Regulating the Internet][2],
a set of brief introductions to the most important concepts in Internet
regulations. Today we add the final section to this guide - a discussion of how
tricky national sovereignty can be online.*

## Difference between a Distributor and a Creator

If you've ever uploaded a home video to YouTube then you know the difference
between a distributor of content and a creator of content. YouTube did not
create the video you uploaded, you did. What YouTube did was distribute the
content you created - it provided the tools and infrastructure that allow
others to watch your video. And while YouTube didnâ€™t make your video, if your
video ended up getting millions of hits, you know your Internet fame would not
exist without YouTube's distribution.

Distributors are important to have, so speech and intellectual property
regulation is usually careful to encourage their existence. For this reason,
distributors are usually not legally responsible for the obscene, libelous, or
infringing content they distribute as long as they follow reasonable regulatory
requirements (see [Section 230's Safe Harbor][1] for an example.) If they were
legally responsible, then distributors would have to check out every book for
sale in their store or every video uploaded to their site. Such a task could be
ridiculously expensive, so nobody would want to open a bookstore or create
YouTube.
