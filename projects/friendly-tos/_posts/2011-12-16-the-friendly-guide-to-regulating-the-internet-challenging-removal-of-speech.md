FriendlyToS is no longer on the Internet. The content of the originally
referenced post has been reproduced below.

*Understanding why Internet regulations are the way that they are is confusing.
So, FriendlyToS is creating [The Friendly Guide to Regulating the Internet][5],
a set of brief introductions to the most important concepts in Internet
regulations. Today we add the final section to this guide - a discussion of how
tricky national sovereignty can be online.*

## Challenging Removal of Speech

Let's say a copyright owner can go around the Internet and take down works that
infringe their copyrighted material. Under this law an overzealous creator of
The Simpsons might take down millions of original animated videos like
[this one][2] just because these videos also contain cartoon people, [cats][3],
and [hamsters][4]. If there is no process that allows the creators of these
videos to prove their originality and get them back online, then millions of
people might be unable to share billions of ideas because of a handful of
copyright holders who are simply being a bit too protective of their creations.

The power to remove the speech of others is dangerous. Even when used with good
intentions, removing the speech of others can end important arguments and
innovations. For this reason, speech regulations usually allow a person to
challenge the removal of his or her speech. Speech regulations that do not
allow challenges are generally considered bad policy, and either do not become
law, or do not survive the scrutiny of the courts.
