FriendlyToS is no longer on the Internet. The content of the originally
referenced post has been reproduced below.

*Understanding why Internet regulations are the way that they are is confusing.
So, FriendlyToS is creating [The Friendly Guide to Regulating the Internet][2],
a set of brief introductions to the most important concepts in Internet
regulations. Today we add the final section to this guide - a discussion of how
tricky national sovereignty can be online.*

## Overbroadness and Vagueness

Suppose your friend wanted to stop people from reproducing a picture she made,
so she demands that everybody she knows stop copying any pictures. That sounds
like a bit of an overreaction right? Or she says that people cannot share her
picture. Well what does "share" mean? Can I post a link to her original picture
on Facebook?

A number of speech regulations have been struck down because they were
overbroad - they needlessly regulated "good" speech that is beyond the scope of
the regulation's focus. Speech regulations have also been struck down because
they were vague - the laws did a poor job of defining what would be a
punishable action.
