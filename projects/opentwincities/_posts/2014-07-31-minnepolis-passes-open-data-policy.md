> At about noon yesterday, Minneapolis became the 16th city in the United
> States to enact an Open Data Policy. This policy is both a significant step

> evolution of the [city's work via innovation, engagement, trust, and collaboration](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/citygoals/index.htm)
> in the 21st century. It is both the result of a lot of hard work, and the
> foundation of more work to come from city leaders, city staff, private
> organizations, and the citizens of Minneapolis.
