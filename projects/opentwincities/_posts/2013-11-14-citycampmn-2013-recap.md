A [new post is up at Open Twin Cities][1] about the recent CityCampMN
unconference co-hosted with E-Democracy.

> The biggest reason I call CityCampMN 2013 a fantastic success is the energy
> and vibe I saw that day. Through out the day I saw people talking EVERYWHERE.
> In sessions. In hallways. At lunch. During breakfast. At the reception. There
> was never a lull during the unconference; everybody had too much to talk
> about.
