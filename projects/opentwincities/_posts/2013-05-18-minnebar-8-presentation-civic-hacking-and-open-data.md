About a month ago I gave an introductory presentation about civic hacking, open
data, [Open Twin Cities](http://www.opentwincities.org), and some events we 
have coming up at [Minnebar](http://minnestar.org/minnebar/) - Minnesota's 
version of [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/) (and one of the biggest in the 
country.) A few days ago Minnebar put videos up of all the presentations.

The slides used in this presentation can be downloaded [here](http://www.opentwincities.org/files/civic_hacking_and_open_data.pptx).

As I said, it was an introductory presentation, with the first 10 or 15 minutes
attempting to explain what civic hacking and open data are. The audience was a
mix of Minnesota's tech scene, with a slight bias towards small businesses and
start-ups. So this is largely a non-technical talk designed for a room that 
includes developers, designers, and project managers, and entrepreneurs.
