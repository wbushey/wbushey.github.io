> Hack for MN 2013 was a huge success, and a fun weekend (see some of the fun 
> in our new [Flickr Group](http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?m=pool&w=2264766%40N22&q=hackformn))! 
> Minnesota's version of [Hack for Change](http://hackforchange.org) - the 
> national event of events that brought citizens, community leaders, civil 
> servants, and technologists together to experiment and address community 
> issues across the country - brought out 75 participants who worked on 
> 13 great projects over the course of 19 hours. Now that we've all had some 
> time to relax and reflect on this event, I'd like to share some thoughts on 
> this milestone event for civic innovation in the Twin Cities.
