Yup, via a chain of events I have landed an internship at
[The Berkman Center][1], a center within the Harvard Law School. Starting June
1st I will be developing [TermsWatch][2], a web service that will provide
notification of updates to, and plain English explanations of, those Terms of
Use and Terms of Service agreements (Terms) that every website and piece of
software makes you consent to.

The whole thing started back in February when
[Facebook updated its Terms of Use][3]. The update occurred on February 4th,
but nobody noticed the changes until the 15th (keep in mind that Facebook has
around 175 million active users.)

Furthermore, Facebook's Terms of Use included an implied consent clause
regarding changes. As many as 175 million users consented to the February 4th
changes completely unaware that they were consenting to anything or that any
change had occurred. This lack of notice presented an obvious problem, so I
began to think about a program that would monitor Facebook's Terms of Use and
alert individuals when a change was detected.

Before I could begin working on the program Facebook implemented its
[new, democratic process for updating its Terms][4] (now called the Statement
of Rights and Responsibilities.) Satisfied that notice was now being given, I
joined many other Facebook users in commenting on the proposed Rights and
Responsibilities. While it was great that users were given a voice in the
process, it also became clear that most of us (myself included) have no idea
what a lot of the language means in the Statement of Rights and
Responsibilities, or why it needs to be included. One particular clause angered
and disturbed a lot of users by allowing Facebook the right to transfer and
sublicense its ability to reproduce and modify users' content. Fortunately, a
number of individuals were able to explain why such a clause is required (so
Facebook can allow third party applications to access and use its users' data.)
Still, it became obvious that the dense legalese of the Statement of Rights and
Responsibilities is too difficult for most (aside from experts and
professionals in law) to read and understand.

It was about this time that Google started the application process for its
[Summer of Code][5]. At first I scanned through the list of project ideas
related to technology and society (my emerging area of interest,) but after a
while I thought it would be neat to work on a generalized version of the
program I had thought of in February that would monitor a site's (or software
provider's) Terms for changes. I also thought about the difficulty of reading
Terms and decided that the program would be much more useful if it included a
way for legal experts to attach plain English explanations to the Terms. With
all this in mind I wrote an application for the Summer of Code.

All Summer of Code programs need to be written for one of the available
mentoring organizations. Since this program appeared to be a perfect fit for
it, I applied with the Berkman Center as my mentor. Since I was part of last
year's Summer of Code, I figured I would easily be part of this year's, so I
sat back and waited for the good word. Less than four days after the submission
deadline I got the not so good word that my application was considered
ineligible. But, no sooner had I found out about the ineligibility than I
received an email from the Berkman Center; they loved the idea and they asked
me to apply to their internship program and spend the summer in Cambridge.
Well, I couldn't say no to that, so I applied. The process went smoothly, I was
accepted, and now I am starting to pack, because I have to move in less than
two weeks.
