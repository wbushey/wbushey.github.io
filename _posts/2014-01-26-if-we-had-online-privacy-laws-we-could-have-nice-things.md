(Note: this is a copy of <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/twin-cities-brigade/3qACA9NcCuA" target="_blank">a post I made in the Open Twin Cities forum</a>, responding to a thread about The <a href="http://m.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/01/lessons-from-the-worlds-most-tech-savvy-government/283341/" target="_blank">Atlantic's recent article on Estonia's leading use of digital information and authentication assets to create a modern platform for markets and governance</a>.)

If we could learn just one lesson from Estonia, I'd like it to be this:

It is difficult to get to this level of reliance on digital assets without 
robust legal protection and remedies for violation from private and public 
actors. The US has a patchwork system for regulating online privacy, with weak
self-regulation in most areas, but more significant, actionable regulation in
the areas on which significant markets rely on - financial and health
information. U.S. online privacy regulation is guided by [principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_Fair_Information_Practice)
that I believe are inline with the Estonian system, but they are largely
unenforceable because they are only principles, not statutes. This creates a
pretty ill-defined privacy system that I believe is preventing the market from
stepping in to provide the type of personal data storage infrastructure that
Estonia has built. It's not for lack of interest - I believe 
Google/Amazon/Microsoft/>Facebook/etc... would jump into this space if the
rules were defined. In fact, via the various authentication initiatives of the
last few years (login via Facebook/Google+/Personas/Oauth), the private sector
has already been nibbling at the edges of this problem. But, when nobody is
quite sure what the rules regarding personal data privacy are right now, let
alone what they will be in a year, nobody is going to put serious money into
creating the digital personal information storage, authentication, and access
infrastructure that Estonia has created.

In the US I think a comprehensive privacy regime would have to be created at
the federal level - a combination of Congressional action and FTC rules. But,
California has shown that states can apply privacy protections beyond what the
federal government provides. So a question to consider might be: what
additional privacy rights or protections can Minnesota extend to its citizens
that would aid the creation of an economic and governance system that leverages
digital infrastructure as well as Estonia?
