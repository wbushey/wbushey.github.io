    About a month ago I gave an introductory presentation about civic hacking, open data, <a href="http://www.opentwincities.org" target="_blank">Open Twin Cities</a>, and some events we have coming up at <a href="http://minnestar.org/minnebar/" target="_blank">Minnebar</a> &#8211; Minnesota&#8217;s version of <a href="http://barcamp.org/" target="_blank">BarCamp</a> (and one of the biggest in the country.) A few days ago Minnebar put videos up of all the presentations.

    As I said, it was an introductory presentation, with the first 10 or 15 minutes attempting to explain what civic hacking and open data are. The audience was a mix of Minnesota&#8217;s tech scene, with a slight bias towards small businesses and start-ups. So this is largely a non-technical talk designed for a room that includes developers, designers, and project managers, and entrepreneurs.
