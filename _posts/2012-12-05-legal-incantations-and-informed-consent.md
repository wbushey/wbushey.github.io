(This is a response to a [piece written by Edward Felten for Tech Policy](http://www.techpolicy.com/Blog/Featured-Blog-Post/Facebook-Copyright-Statement-Not-Entirely-Silly.aspx).
Check that out first, then read one.)

One technicality that Felten is overlooking is the user's informed consent upon
registration. When users sign up, they opt-in to the terms as offered by
Facebook. Then Facebook, its third party partners, and FTC, all convince
themselves that the user actually read and understood the offered terms, and
knowingly consented to them. This is the basis of informed consent online, and
despite everybody involved knowing that the 'informed' part is a farce, it is 
what makes Facebook's claims of consent (tenuously) binding, while making 
users' claims of consent a meme.

As an informed user who consented, you know about and consented to the clause
that allows Facebook to change the terms of its agreement with you, and get
automatic consent from you. Basically, because you read the terms (you did read
them, right?), you consented not only to the terms and conditions as defined at
the time you registered, but you also agreed to all future versions of the
terms and conditions. At no point did Facebook agree to the same perpetual
consent of terms and conditions as modified by you. Facebook never opted in on
the clause 'Our continued availability of our website, and hosting of your
content, constitutes our acceptance of your amended terms.' This is why the
legal incarnation meme doesn't work: Facebook isn't bound to consent to changes
defined by users to the terms and conditions in the same way that users are
bound to consent to changes defined by Facebook.

OK, so that explains why a Facebook user can not simple change his/her
agreement. Now lets look at the terms of use that Felten includes, courtesy of
Cory Doctorow

> READ CAREFULLY. By reading this post you agree, on behalf of your employer,

The problem with this is there is no informed consent at all. In order to be
informed of the terms as defined above, I have to read them. But by reading
them, I consent. I can not be informed of the terms and decide not to consent.
For all of the flack that Facebook takes about unilaterally defining its
agreement with me, I at least had the option to decline after reading when I
registered with Facebook.

All that said, I agree with the spirit of Felten's post. The informed consent
distinction is easily overlooked by people because websites and the FTC
overlook the informing part everyday. It's no wonder that Felten writes "any
explanation as to *why* [legal incantations] should be unenforceable would tend
to undermine Facebook's own claims about its terms of use and related 
statements." Everybody involved knows the consent system is built on looking
the other way. If Facebook calls attention to that, the court, or policy
makers, might finally call into question just how binding those terms and
conditions truly are.

Besides, in a day and age in which operating agreements are no longer
negotiated, why should corporations have all the fun of broadcasting legalese?
