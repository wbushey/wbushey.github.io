My blog has been pretty quiet over the last couple of months as I have adjusted
to life as a graduate student. Aside from starting grad school, I have also
started my job as a research assistant for the
[Center for Science, Technology, and Public Policy][1] at the
[Humphrey Institute][2], which involves working with the
[Center for Sustainable Polymers][3] (CSP) to promote their work and educate
the public about the benefits of sustainable polymers. That means, among other
things, that I am blogging for the center. Therefore, every once in a while,
starting today, you will see me post a quick summary of, and link to, a post I
have made for CSP. Why? Well shameless self promotion is what the Internet is
all about.

> Plastic, the material that is as essential to modern life as electricity,
> faces a bleak future due to the impending shriveling of Earth's oil supply.
> As Karen Youso recently discovered for her article
> "[Six days without plastic? Good luck][4]", we really can't sustain modern
> life without plastic. This begs the question, what are we going to do?
> Fortunately, recent scientific advancements have shown that we can continue
> to manufacture plastic by replacing oil with biobased sources.
