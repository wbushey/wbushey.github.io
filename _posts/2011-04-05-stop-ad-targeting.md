Below is some information on opting-out of tracking by websites and
advertisers, and preventing sites from tracking you. This page isn't meant to
be comprehensive, nor does it compare methods/tools; it simply provides some
useful information to help you protect your privacy.

## What is 'Opting-Out'?

The basic idea is that if you tell sites or advertising networks that you do
not want to be tracked, they won't track you. Many websites and ad networks let
you opt-out of tracking by clicking a link and/or following instructions
provided in their privacy policies. By opting-out, the site or network will put
a cookie on your computer instructing the site's or network's ads and code to
not track you. Manually opting-out of tracking and managing those opt-out
cookies can be hard, but fortunately some of the tools described below automate
the process and make opting-out much easier.

## What are 'Trackers'?

Sites and networks use a number of methods, collectively called 'trackers', to
track your browsing habits and send that collected information back to their
servers. Some of the methods include various types of cookies (browser cookies,
flash cookies, Javascript cookies, etc...) and web bugs - very small images
that you can not see but that can be used to let a site or network know that
you have visited a particular website. There are basically two ways to prevent
trackers from tracking you: you can opt-out of tracking as described above, or
you can build the privacy equivalent of a wall around your browser by using
tools that stop trackers from reaching your browser and doing what they do to
track you.

## Tools

**Ghostery** - Available for Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Opera,
Ghostery is a plugin which prevents trackers from running in your browser and
sending information back to sites and ad networks. You can download it at
<http://www.ghostery.com/>.

**BetterPrivacy** - This is a Firefox plugin that deletes sophisticated cookies
known as Super-Cookies. Super-Cookies work by storing information in many
different places on your computer, and can be frustratingly hard (or
impossible) to get rid of on your own. You can install BetterPrivacy at
<http://netticat.ath.cx/BetterPrivacy/BetterPrivacy.htm>.

**TACO** - Targeted Advertising Cookie Opt-Out (TACO) is a Firefox plugin that
automatically opts you out of tracking from over 100 websites and ad networks
by maintaining opt-out cookies on your computer. Older versions of TACO
(available [here][1]) just set opt-out cookies, while newer versions (available
[here][2]) are combined with additional privacy tools to create a Swiss Army 
Knife of privacy. Those using the older version of TACO may wish to install
Ghostery to take care of trackers, while those who download the newer version
can block trackers by opening TACO’s options, selecting the “Opt-Out & Block”
tab, and then choosing to block all of the web tracking categories listed.

## Manually Opting-Out of Tracking

Using one or more of the above tools is the easiest way of preventing sites
from monitoring you, since they block or opt you out of tracking by hundreds of
sites. Furthermore, TACO makes sure that you do not delete opt-out cookies when
you delete all your other cookies. But if you can't, or don't want to use these
tools, or if you are just curious, here are links to information on how you can
manually opt out of some of the most common advertising networks and some of
the web's most popular sites.

**Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)** - The NAI has developed a page that
Internet users can use to opt-out of  tracking by dozens of advertising
networks: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

**Facebook** - This explanation for opting out of Facebook's Social Ads program
comes from Nicholas Jackson of The Atlantic. The full article can be found
[here][3].

> To opt out of social ads, login to your Facebook profile and click on the
> 'Account' tab in the upper right-hand corner of the homepage. From the
> drop-down menu, select 'Account Settings' and tab over to 'Facebook Ads.' If
> this is your first time visiting this page, a window explaining the Social
> Ads campaign will pop-up, explaining that "[y]our privacy settings always
> apply to your Facebook content, including any content about you in a social
> ads." Which is exactly why we’re going to change those right now. Close the
> pop-up window and, using the drop-down menu under 'Ads shown by third party
> applications,' select 'No one.' Save the changes to ensure that you'll never
> appear in a third-party social advertisement. Then, if you want to block
> social ads completely, scroll down and change the second drop-down menu to
> 'No one' as well.

## Snail Mail Opt-Outs

Advertising and solicitations that come in your physical mail box are also a
threat to privacy, and a nuisance. Fortunately, there are ways to opt-out of
mail based solicitation too.

**OptOutPrescreen** - <http://www.optoutprescreen.com> - A result Congressional and
FTC action, this service is operated by the major consumer credit reporting
companies and allows consumers to add or remove their names from the lists that
credit card companies use to send credit card offers.
