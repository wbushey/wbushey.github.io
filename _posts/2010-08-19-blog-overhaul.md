I've been wanting to do this for quite a while, but this week I finally got
around to overhauling The Web's Bushiest Site. I've migrated the blog to
WordPress and got a spiffy and elegant new theme.

Before the migration the blog had been running on Joomla, which seems to be a
capable foundation for a multipurpose site. However, after 15 months I grew
tired of its weaknesses as a blog. Joomla forces the use of a two tiered
category hierarchy for posts which I found to be almost entirely useless and
frustrating. It also has a terrible preview function. I could never know what
a post would look like until it was actually live, which meant I often had to
publish a post and then edit it several times to fix formatting issues.
Finally, Joomla doesn't include comment support out of the box and none of the
comment plugins available have a good mix of ease of use, ease of
administration, and good visual design.

As for WordPress, the platform is meant to only do one thing and it does that
one thing really well. In my opinion the themes and plugins available for
WordPress are much nicer for blogging than those available for Joomla. The
category hierarchy is way more flexible, and the admin interface is much
cleaner and easier to use than Joomla's. Finally, comment support out of the
box is great.

Comment on your love/hate of the new blog; I always appreciate feedback.
