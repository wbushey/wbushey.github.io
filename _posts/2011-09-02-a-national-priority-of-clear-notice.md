A year and a half ago, Alan Siegel described in less than 5 minutes why the 
problems of privacy and consumer trust run rampant on the Internet. That
legalese that every website presents you doesn't actually inform you of
anything. It is a tool of websites to obtain legal authorizations and
protection.

Privacy policies were not meant to be used this way. The FTC originally
promoted privacy policies as a tool for informing consumers of the benefits and
risks of using websites. Over the years they have evolved into dense blocks of
text that are not only useless to consumers, they are harmful to consumers.

Why aren't clear notices a national priority? Siegel thinks they should be. The
FTC has stated [again][1] and [again][2] that consumer notices should be clear
and easy to understand. Unfortunately, industry self-regulation bodies and
Congress don't seem to be as interested in presenting consumers with clear and
transparent information.

Why aren't clear notices a national priority? I think we should ask the DMA's
[Consumer, Ethics, and Privacy](mailto:privacy@the-dma.org) department, or IAB
President [Randall Rothenberg](mailto:Randall@iab.net). More importantly, we
should ask that question to our [Representatives][3] and [Senators][4]. We
might also want to ask, why is it OK for businesses to trick consumers? Why
aren't consumers treated with respect by our businesses and our government?
