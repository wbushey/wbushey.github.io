I recently attended the University of Minnesota's Energy, Economic and
Environmental conference, and have written a post about my initial reactions.

> A friend of mine joked that we may soon hear that "the environment is a
> conspiracy by the man," and E3's keynote speaker, Dr. Lawrence Kazmerski,
> noted that the conference's size vindicated the work and concerns that he has
> built his career around. The environment is no longer a fringe subject, and I
> for one am relieved.
