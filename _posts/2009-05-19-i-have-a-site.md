Well here it is, I finally have a home on the web. I figured I was being a
pretty bad computer nerd by not having a site of my own, so I setup Joomla on
my web host and started tweaking it. In the coming weeks I will be putting up
information about myself: what I have done, what I want to do, and what I am
doing now. And for anybody who wants to follow the happenings of Bill Bushey,
I will also be using this site as a blog so you can keep tabs on what I am
doing.
