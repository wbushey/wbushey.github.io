Earlier this week I got the chance to do a little Q & A with Minnesota's version of TechCrunch, [Tech.mn][1]. Here's an excerpt:

> **What excites you most about where technology is headed?**
> 
> There is a growing movement, inside and outside of government, to use technology to serve civic needs. More government information is being digitized and opened up for coders to make useful apps that help citizens interact with their governments. From government's point of view, more digital information means greater use of computing to plan and execute government actions. And while most of the major media hasn't caught on yet, more available data means innovative and deeper reporting on important issues. Hopefully, that will someday turn into substantive public discussions about policies and public issues.
